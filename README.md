# COVID-19 spread from January 23 through March 14th
### Data is from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

Every purple dot is a single case, green is a recovery, and red is a death.

A pre-rendered video is included in this REPO.

Since there are over 150,000 the FPS is hard-coded to 5 FPS, but you can view this in your browser here: http://efhiii.github.io/COVID-19

The Animation spreads out data for a single day evenly (randomly) throughout that day's time period, and in a cluster around the coordinates of the region it occurred in. I don't have the actual location of every single case, just the country, and state/province for the US, China, and a few others.
